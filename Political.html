            our
            close
            partner in the West African region. My visit will be an opportunity to build upon our Strategic
            Partnership
            that is
            based on shared belief in democracy and pluralism. I am also eagerly looking forward to meeting the

            G-20 to people's G-20 and mainstreamed the priorities of the Global South into its agenda. This year, Brazil
            has built upon India's legacy. I look
            forward to meaningful discussions in keeping with our vision of "One Earth, One Family, One Future." I will
