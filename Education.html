            collaborate to enable deep-tech innovation, scale up digital skilling</h2>
        <p>
            The Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) and the Andhra Pradesh government have signed eight
            agreements to
            foster innovation and development.

            The collaboration focuses on ‘transformative initiatives’ in areas including deep-tech innovation, digital
            skilling,
            aviation, maritime research, and governance systems, promising a major boost to the state’s growth
            trajectory.

            As part of the agreement, IIT Madras will provide consultancy to the Andhra Pradesh government on
            establishing a
            deep-tech incubation park at Amaravati. The institute will also facilitate partnerships for the Government
            with
            international universities, Prof. V. Kamakoti, Director, IIT Madras said.
            IIT Madras, through its initiatives such as SWAYAM Plus and Vidhya Shakti, will offer skilling programmes to
            students
            and teachers across Andhra Pradesh. The programmes, the director added, implemented in partnership with
            volunteer
            organisations, seek to elevate the quality of education and prepare the workforce for a digital future.

            Speaking about the collaboration, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in a post on X (formerly
            Twitter)
            said: “Met with a delegation from IIT Madras, led by Director Prof. Veezhinathan Kamakoti to explore
            transformative
            collaborations for Andhra Pradesh.”
        </p>

        <p>IIT Madras will work on boosting the aviation industry in Andhra Pradesh by supporting the development of
            Kuppam and
            Puttaparthi as logistics and maintenance hubs. This initiative is expected to open up new avenues for
            economic growth in
            the region, Prof. Kamakoti said adding that it will also work with the AP government to impart a thrust to
            maritime
            research, communications and coastal energy harvesting technologies.

            Vizag’s role as an international internet gateway will be strengthened through IIT Madras’ expertise in
            global data
            connectivity. This move, the professor said, is expected to transform Vizag into a critical hub for digital
            infrastructure.</p>


        <p>In Amaravati, IIT Madras will assist in the creation of a Smart Tech-Enabled Sports City, combining
            technology with
            infrastructure to position the city as a hub for sports innovation.

            Leveraging its expertise in data science and artificial intelligence, IIT Madras will support the
            development of
            real-time governance systems and software infrastructure for Andhra Pradesh, enhancing efficiency and
            decision-making
            processes.
            The Andhra Pradesh Government has signed eight MoUs with IIT Madras to launch transformative initiatives
            across various
            sectors.



            These include setting up an international deep-tech innovation hub in Amaravati, scaling up digital skilling
            platforms
            like SWAYAM+ and IITM Pravartak, and launching mentorship programs for students and teachers.



            Plans are also in place to develop Kuppam and Puttaparthi as logistics hubs and enhance Visakhapatnam’s role
            as a global
            internet gateway. Other initiatives focus on maritime research, smart sports infrastructure in Amaravati,
            and
            integrating Artificial Intelligence and data science into Real-Time Governance Society (RTGS) operations.
            These efforts
            aim to boost development and innovation in the state.</p>

        <h3>India needs 2,500 universities to accommodate 50% students: NITI Aayog CEO</h3>
        <p>India needs to significantly increase its number of universities to meet the growing demand for higher
            education,
            according to NITI Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam. Speaking at the Indian School of Business (ISB), he
            highlighted the need
            to double the number of universities to 2,500 in order to enroll 50% of eligible students in higher
            education.
            Currently, India has only 1,200 universities, accommodating just 29% of the student age cohort, which is far
            below the
            target.

            Subrahmanyam emphasised that while over 10 years, one university and two colleges have opened each week, the
            number of
            institutions remains insufficient to meet the rising demand for quality education.

            He pointed out, "At least 50% of the students should be in colleges. We need to double the colleges and
            universities in
            the country. The country needs 2,500 universities." Though not all existing institutions may meet high
            standards, the
            sheer increase in number is necessary, he said.

            He also suggested that educational delivery methods may need to evolve to ensure access and quality,
            reflecting a need
            for systemic changes in how education is provided across India. Expanding the number of institutions, along
            with
            improving the quality of education, will be crucial to providing opportunities for India’s youth and meeting
            the demands
            of an ever-growing student population. The expansion of universities is viewed as an essential step to
            improving India’s
            workforce and supporting its economic future.
