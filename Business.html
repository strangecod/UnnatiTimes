            Group forms centre to push 2030 growth strategy</h2>
        <p>
            As part of its ‘Vision 2030’ growth strategy, Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group has formed a corporate centre for
            expansion,

        <h3>Reliance Jio IPO set for 2025, retail debut much later: Report</h3>
        <p>NEW DELHI/HONG KONG - Billionaire Mukesh Ambani targets a 2025 Mumbai listing for his telecom business Jio,
            valued by
            analysts at over $100 billion, and plans to launch his retail unit's IPO much later, two people familiar
            with the matter
            told Reuters.


            Reliance Industries' boss Ambani hasn't updated his IPO timelines after saying in 2019 that Reliance Jio and
            Reliance
            Retail would "move towards" a listing within five years.

            In recent years, Ambani, Asia's richest man, raised $25 billion collectively for digital, telecom and retail
            businesses
            from the likes of KKR, General Atlantic and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, valuing both ventures at above
            $100 billion.

            The two sources said Reliance has now firmed up plans to launch the Reliance Jio IPO in 2025 as it
            internally believes
            it has achieved a stable business and revenue stream in becoming India's No. 1 telecom player with 479
            million
            subscribers.
