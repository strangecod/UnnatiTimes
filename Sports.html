            Test
            Against Australia; Jasprit Bumrah Named as Replacement</h2>


        <p>India captain Rohit Sharma won’t play in the first Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test between Australia and India in
            Perth starting Friday as he has informed the Board of Control for Cricket in India that he needed more time
            with
            his wife after the birth of their second child earlier this week. Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah, the
            vice-captain of
            the team, will take over the reins in Rohit’s absence. Rohit is set to play the second match, a pink-ball
            Test,
            that begins in Adelaide on December 6.</p>

        <p>Because of Rohit’s absence, the selectors have told Devdutt Paddikal, who was touring with the India A squad,
            to
            stay back in Australia. Paddikal will be added to the 18-member squad in Rohit’s place for the first Test
            match
            at the Opus Stadium in Perth.</p>

        <p>“We were hoping that he (Rohit) will travel but he has informed the BCCI that he can’t go now as he needs
            some
            more time. He will be flying to Australia for the pink-ball Test match, the second match, in Adelaide. There
            is
            a nine-day gap between the first and second Test matches, so Rohit will be able to be there on time,” a BCCI
            official confirmed.</p>

        <p>The senior selection committee was hopeful of Rohit, the captain, travelling to Australia for the first Test
            of
            what is going to be a long summer with matches in Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. With the
            team
            suffering a 0-3 whitewash at home at the hands of New Zealand, the Test tour of Australia will be a litmus
            test
            for the side coming off a bad run of form and collective batting failure.</p>

        <h3>KL Rahul set to play</h3>
        <p>India’s batting line-up will definitely see changes after Shubman Gill fractured his thumb while fielding
            during
            match simulation on Saturday. Gill will miss the first Test, opening a path for KL Rahul to make it to the
            playing XI. In Rohit’s absence, Dhruv Jurel, the wicket-keeper, may get a look in purely as a batsman. Jurel
            made
            80 and 64 in a tour game against Australia A and looked the most assured batsman at the crease.“My aim is to
            obviously get back into the T20 team. I’ve always wanted to be an all-format player, and that desire and
            drive haven’t changed over the years. I want to still play for India in all three formats and have done that
            for many
            years,” Rahul told Star Sports.

            “I’ve been out of the T20 team for a while, and I know where I stand as a player and what I need to do to
            get back. So,
            I look forward to this IPL season to give me that platform to enjoy my cricket and play the way I want to,”
            he added.By: Sports Desk

            KL Rahul in a recent interaction said that he wants to use the next IPL as a vehicle to stage a comeback to
            the Indian
            T20I side.

            “My aim is to obviously get back into the T20 team. I’ve always wanted to be an all-format player, and that
            desire and
            drive haven’t changed over the years. I want to still play for India in all three formats and have done that

            Rahul was not retained by the Lucknow Super Giants and will go into the auction pool in the IPL Mega Auction
            set to take
            place on November 24-25.

            The LSG franchise finished 3rd in the 2022 and 2023 seasons under Rahul. But Lucknow could not make its way
            into the
            play-offs last season which might have added to the skipper’s non retention.</p>
